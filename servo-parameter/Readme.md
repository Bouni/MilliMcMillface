# Servo parameters

These prameters are loaded onto the servodrives unsing the (unfortunately) proprietary, Windows Software called [CX-Drive](https://industrial.omron.de/de/products/cx-drive).

The parameters however can be set using the keys on the drives. The values we use can be seen in the PDF files.
